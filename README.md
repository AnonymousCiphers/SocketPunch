Send and install CIA files using FBI and this app!

I recommend using GBATemp's @wjchen's FBI build: https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0mbec3zuwj9t4f/FBI-chen-fix4.cia?dl=0

1. Write the IP Address of your 3DS. FBI will tell you which it is once you press Y in the main screen.
2. Search and add CIA files to SocketPunch.
3. Punch them!
